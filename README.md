## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure
- **CSS3**: 
  - 3D Transforms (`transform-style: preserve-3d`)
  - Backface Visibility (`backface-visibility: hidden`)
  - Smooth Transitions (`transition: transform 1s`)
  - Hover Effects
- **Font Awesome**: Social media icons
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font family

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Card Structure**: The card consists of two faces - front and back
2. **3D Perspective**: CSS `perspective` property creates 3D space
3. **Transform Style**: `preserve-3d` maintains 3D positioning
4. **Backface Visibility**: Hidden backface prevents seeing through the card
5. **Hover Animation**: On hover, the card rotates 180 degrees around the Y-axis

## 📝 Usage

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Hover over the card to see the animation
4. Customize the content, images, and styling as needed
